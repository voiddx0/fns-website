              This game is a Yandere Simulator Fan-Game which was originally made for my sister, but i decided to upload it so anyone can play.

        <div class="faq-body">
          <div class="faq-body-container">
            <p>Here is a short list of some of the features you can look forward to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Persistent Reputation:</strong>
                  When you are spotted doing something incriminating, students will gossip about you. 
                  When your reputation is low, students will be cautious around you, and will consider you to be suspicious. 
                  When your reputation is high, students will let their guard down around you, and will be willing to do favors for you.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Sanity Level:</strong>
                When you perform an act of violence, you will lose Sanity. 
                This will cause you to appear visibly insane. If you lose too much Sanity, people will be able to tell that you are insane just by looking at you. 
                If the boy you love sees you like this, he could never love you, and the game would be over.
              </li>

              The protagonist is named "Ketsumi-chan", and the object of her affection is named "Senpai-kun" (or "Senpai-chan" depending on their gender). 
              Even though in the games code/subtitles, Ketsumi, is referred to as Yandere-chan. This will change in a later version of the game.

                It sort of is, I would implement some actual core mechanics for this game then i mess around and make other unnecessary stuff.

          <div class="faq-body-container">
            <p>
                Currently, I am using the Unity game engine to develop Futusu no Seito. But I would like to switch to Unreal Engine. Which is way more powerful than the Unity game engine.

        <div class="faq-head"><h3>What are the minimum specs / system requirements to play Futusu no Seito?</h3></div>
        <div class="faq-body">
          <div class="faq-body-container">
            <p>Because the game is currently in development, it is changing all the time. I am constantly improving the performance and increasing the optimization of the code. Thus, the minimum specs are always getting lower.</p>
            <p>I can tell you that you need at least 4GB of RAM to be able to run the game in the first place, otherwise your computer will run out of memory while trying to load the school scene.</p>
            <p>To run the game at over 55 FPS consistently, you'd need at least a i7 5820k processor, and at least a GTX 970 graphics card. (The hardware I just named is 5 years old.)</p>
